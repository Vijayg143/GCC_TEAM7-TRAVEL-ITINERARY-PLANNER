        <h1> Indian Temples History</h1>
        <p class="text-child">

            Historians say Hindu temples did not exist during the Vedic period (1500–500 BCE). According to historian Nirad C. Chaudhuri, the earliest structures that indicate idol worship date back to the 4th or 5th century CE. There was a seminal development in temple architecture between the 6th and the 16th century CE.
